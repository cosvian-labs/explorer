- Wallet functionality for CSV tokens
- Transaction tracking and analysis
- Validator information and staking details
- Governance proposals monitoring
- CosmWasm smart contract support

## Cosvian Protocol
Cosvian is a devnet blockchain designed for retail Point-of-Sale (PoS) fixed-fee experiments, providing a specialized platform for payment processing and retail applications.


## Why does Ping Dashboard rely on official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers?
There are two primary reasons for this choice:

 - Trust: In a decentralized system, it is crucial to avoid relying solely on a single entity. By utilizing official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers, Ping Dashboard ensures that the data is sourced from a network of trusted participants.
 - Limited Resources: As Ping Dashboard plans to list hundreds of Cosmos-based blockchains in the future, it is impractical for the Ping team to operate validators or full nodes for all of them. Leveraging trusted third-party servers allows for more efficient resource allocation.
